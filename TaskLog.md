## Signup & login pages

1. ### Created front-end routes

Packages needed: `tailwindcss` + `daisyui`.

**tailwindcss**: CSS framework.
**daisyui**: Tailwind CSS plugin that adds pre-built UI components and themes.

2. ### Created front-end routes

Packages needed: `react-router-dom`.
**react-router-dom** just links a React component with an URL path, so that we can make a frontend router.

Settings up client-side routing using React {Routes, Route}, where:
 - BrowserRouter enables URL tracking.
 - Routes matches paths.
 - Each Route maps a URL to a React component.

3. ### Connected front-end with back-end

Packages needed: `axios` + `cros` + `zustand`.
**axios** client object used to send http requests to the backend.
**cros** to fix the cross-origin problem.
**zustand** to create a global state that we can share easly to multiple components.

1. On each refresh, i send a get request from the useEffect() hook to "/api/auth/check" route.
>useEffect is a state i created using zustand to call this hook from any react component easly.

2. then the `protectRoute` middleware from the backend is called the check if there is valide user sending the request by checking the jwt from the request `Cookie` header.

3. 
    if the jwt token is valide we send back to the front req.user
    else a throw is catched and we know that there is no user.


4. ### Protect routes based on the authentification status.

We are doing so using the response we got earlier pinging /check from back-end. (userAuthObj)
+ Displaying spinner on page refresh.
We are using conditional rendering.
    -> for example:
        if the the request containes this endpoint "http://localhost:5173/" but the user isn't yet logged in, we redirect him to the "http://localhost:5173/login" page.

5. ### Build signup page.

Packages needed: `react-hot-toast` + `https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite`.
**react-hot-toast**: React library used to display notifications, temporary messages that appear on the screen.
**https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite**: importing local UI components and utilities generated by shadcn/ui.

Setting up the front-end for the *Signup* + *Login* + *Navbar*.

Handling the submit Button for Signup using *handleSubmit()* to parse the form data using *validateForm()*
if the form data is valide -> *signup()* -> send the POST request:
- `const res = await axiosInstance.post("/auth/signup", data)`

to create a new user on the MongoDB.
